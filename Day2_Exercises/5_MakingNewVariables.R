# Making New Variables
#
###########

   # Nearly every time you get a dataset, there will be variables you need for your analyses that
   # the dataset doesn't already include. Sometimes, you can create the variables you need using
   # the ones that already exist. Mutate() is great at helping you create variables.

   # For example, suppose I want to create a variable for whether
   # an animal is AQUATIC and has FINS and call it LIKELY_FISH.
   # animals <- mutate(animals, LIKELY_FISH=aquatic==1 & fins=1)

   # Remember `&` is the logical AND operator.

   # can you make a new variable for animals that HAVE feathers but are
   # NOT airborne?
animals <- mutate(animals, feathers_nofly = feathers==1 & airborne==0)

   # What animals fit that category?
flightless_birds <- filter(animals, feathers_nofly==TRUE)
