# Subsetting with Booleans and the filter() function

# Exercise 1: Subset by boolean
   # In research, we often want to subset our attention to a subset of
   # observations in our data. The filter() function helps us do this easily!

   # For example here's how I could get the names of all the animals that are reptiles:
   # `reptiles <- filter(my_data, type=="reptile")`
   # (the double equal size is for checking equality instead of assigning)

   # OK, your turn! Load in the animals.csv file and try to get just the rows that are mammals.

   # OK, now get just the rows that are mammals AND have tails. 

   # how many animals fit these criteria? 
   #    HINT: remember the nrow() function?
