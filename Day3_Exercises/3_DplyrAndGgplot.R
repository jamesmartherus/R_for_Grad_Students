# Exercise: Combining dplyr and ggplot
#################

### Part A
# Ok, lets combine everything we learned today. Take the inequality data and do the following:
# 1. keep only the state, year, gini, and top10 variables.
# 2. group the data by state
# 3. collapse the data such that each row is one state with the average gini coefficient
# across all years in the data
# 4. sort the data in descending order such that the state with the highest gini
# coefficient comes first. 
#     Hint: you'll need to use a function we haven't learned yet, so you'll have to find it.
#     try here: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/
# Bonus points if you do it all at once using the pipe!


# Part B
# Now decide how to plot this data most clearly. Draw it out on paper!


# Part C
# Create your plot using the ggplot function


# Part D
# Now customize your plot. Try to use the ggplot cheat sheet or google to go beyond the
# customizations we did earlier.
