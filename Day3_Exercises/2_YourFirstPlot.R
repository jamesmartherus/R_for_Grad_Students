# Exercise: Your First Plot
#################

# Look at the ggplot handout I gave you. There are dozens of different geoms that make 
# different types of plots. The first thing you should do before you make a data
# visualization is look at your data and decide the best way to present it might be.

# 1. Pick two variables from either the animals dataset or the inequality dataset. Stick to
# just two for now. We'll add more things like color later. 

# 2. Look at your variables (maybe use the class function to see what their types are)
# and think about the best way to present the data. Draw it out on paper

# 3. Use the handout to try to find the right geom(). I can help you if you can't find one.

# 4. Use the help file for the geom you chose and try to make your plot!
# Remember if you want to store your plot, you have to save it as a new object!
