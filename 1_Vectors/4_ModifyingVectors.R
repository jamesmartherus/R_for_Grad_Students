# Remember those tricks we learned for subsetting vectors?
# We can use those to modify vectors too!

# when we use square brackets on the LEFT side of the assignment operator,
# we can actually modify parts of a vector.

# For example, suppose you don't like the first favorite number in your
# `my_favorite_numbers` vector any more, and you want to replace it with -1.
# Try assigning -1 to the first item in `my_favorite_numbers`.

# Now suppose you love -1 SO MUCH you want to assign it to the first THREE
# spots in `my_favorite_numbers`. Can you figure out how to do it?
