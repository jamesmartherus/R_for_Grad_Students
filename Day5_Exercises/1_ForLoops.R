# For Loops

# Exercise 1: 
# Use a for loop to take the square root of each value in the following vector:
# `vec1 <- c(4, 9, 81, 100, 1000, 10^6)`. Save the results to a new vector called `vec2`.


# Exercise 2:
# Import the animals dataset.
# Use a for loop to add "_var" to the names of the predator, aquatic, and airborne variables.
# Hint 1: first make a vector with those variable names and then use that in your for loop instead
# of numbers, e.g. `for(i in your_vector)``
